The vehicles were in production from 2001 to 2010, and this was the very first model produced after Lamborghini was taken over by Audi, combining Italian creativity with German technical know-how. The Murciélago is named after the famous Spanish fighting bull which embodies Lamborghinis’ aggressive designed, aerodynamically looking body with its distinctive scissor doors. It is driven by a thunderous V12 engine and as a result, achieves astounding performance, some models comfortably surpass 210 mph and a 0-60 mph in just a little over three seconds. With the car’s intelligent four wheel drive and effective aerodynamic design, it was as much effective on turning tracks as it was on flat stretches. The production run saw various versions including the LP640 and the ultra-lightweight SV (SuperVeloce). Till date, the Murciélago is regarded as an important part of automotive history and has been cherished by fans for its incredible strength and ageless design.")

This legendary car was manufactured from 2003 to 2010 as a joint project between McLaren and Mercedes-Benz, fusing the two company’s visions together. The design elements such as broad long curves over the doors, the signature open climbing kind of doors, and the mouth-like expanded grill were all inspired by the original attraction, the 300 SLR from the 1950s. The extravagant body has carbon fiber which along with its astonishing style, also maximizes the vehicle’s performance. What's even more impressive is its horsepower; the car boasts of a 5.4-litre hand-crafted V8 supercharged engine that generates more than 617 horsepower and the car can reach a maximum speed of around 208 mph. The SLR comes in a variety of forms starting from the original roadster form to the limited 722 editiion.
