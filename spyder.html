            <p>The name Spyder refers to a sporty car in this class of vehicle where it stands out due to its lightweight body and the usually open top. It is fitting that engaging such a car would involve a driver being more in touch with the environment around them. Among the automotive manufacturers to have employed the use of the designation Spyder for their high end models include Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche and Audi. Most of these vehicles are beautifully designed with amazing engineering designs that are built for fast movement, efficiency, and luxury. Both the soft and hardtop convertible gives the driver a sense of freedom and a fun feel especially when they go on a spirited drive on an awe inspiring road. Examples of these are the Ferrari 488 Spider Lamborghini Huracan Spyder and Audi R8 Spyder which are all stunning in both performance and beauty. Spyder models are among the most popular among drivers who want to experience an open door feeling while having immense power without losing stability and control.</p>
