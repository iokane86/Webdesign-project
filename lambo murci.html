            <p>The Lamborghini Murcielago is an iconic super car which is a true representation of Italian culture. The vehicles were in production from 2001 to 2010, and this was the very first model produced after Lamborghini was taken over by Audi, combining Italian creativity with German technical know-how. The Murciélago is named after the famous Spanish fighting bull which embodies Lamborghinis’ aggressive designed, aerodynamically looking body with its distinctive scissor doors. It is driven by a thunderous V12 engine and as a result, achieves astounding performance, some models comfortably surpass 210 mph and a 0-60 mph in just a little over three seconds. With the car’s intelligent four wheel drive and effective aerodynamic design, it was as much effective on turning tracks as it was on flat stretches. The production run saw various versions including the LP640 and the ultra-lightweight SV (SuperVeloce). Till date, the Murciélago is regarded as an important part of automotive history and has been cherished by fans for its incredible strength and ageless design</p>
